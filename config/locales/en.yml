# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    title: "Since the beginning, the children of Mesa de las Tablas were destined to ride their longboards with the wind."
    title2: "- Skate Slate  Magazine-"
    p1: "With a meager population of 174, the community of Mesa de las Tablas has one of the best longboarding spots in Northern Mexico. Our mission is to help these young athletes to compete in the “Maryhill Festival of Speed 2015”."
    p2: "The One Dollar Item project is a non-profit initiative developed by The Digital Invaders Interactive School and supported by Patrick Switzer, Rayne Longboards, Orangatang Wheels, Triple 8 Helmets, Holsom Pucks and EDGE Longboardstore. " 
  team:
    p1: "The local crew of troublemakers Toro, Tito, Gerardo and Uriel have been practicing their Longboarding skills for a little more than 4 years."
    p2: "Ever since they met the city longboarders that wandered through their town."
    p3: "Longboarding it’s a very new sport in Mexico but these boys are determined to go against the current, and ride the hills as fast as the wind. It's time to face the... challenge."

    q1: "How do I help?"
    a1: "You can compete for one or more of the available items. Donate as little as one buck, and you’re in."
    q2: "How does it work??"
    a2: "Donate $1 U.S. Dollar or more to become the “temporary owner” of the item. If someone else already owns it, you can “steal” it from him. A random dynamic will determine the item’s final (and real) owner."
    q3: "How do I win?"
    a3: "Our ambassador Patrick Switzer will announce when an item is no longer for sale and determine the winner with a random dynamic. It all depends on Patrick’s crazy imagination."
    q4: "If you can afford these awesome items, how come you’re asking for money?"
    a4: "All the items we are having for sale where generously donated by our sponsors. This is a non-profit cause with the only objective to take the kids of Team Venados to compete at Maryhill."
    q5: "Any other question?"
