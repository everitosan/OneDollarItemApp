# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  about:
    title: "Buy a deck, a pair of trucks, a set of wheels, a pair of pucks or a full-face helmet for the price of one dollar."
    p1: "The One Dollar Item project is a non-profit initiative developed by The Digital Invaders Interactive School and supported by Patrick Switzer, Rayne Longboards, Orangatang Wheels, Triple 8 Helmets, Holsom Pucks and Edge Longboard store."
    p2: "Our mission is to help the young athletes of the rural community of Mesa de las Tablas (population 174) to compete in the “Maryhill Festival of Speed 2015”." 
  team:   
    p1: "The local crew of troublemakers Toro, Tito, Gerardo and Uriel have been practicing their Longboarding skills for a little more than 4 years."
    p2: "Ever since they met the city longboarders that wandered through their town."
    p3: "Longboarding it’s a very new sport in Mexico but these boys are determined to go against the current, and ride the hills as fast as the wind. It's time to face the... challenge."
  howitworks:
    q1: "How do I help?"
    a1: "You can compete for one or more of the available items. Donate as little as one buck, and you’re in."
    q2: "How does it work??"
    a2: "Donate $1 U.S. Dollar or more to become the “temporary owner” of the item. If someone else already owns it, you can “steal” it from him. A random dynamic will determine the item’s final (and real) owner."
    q3: "How do I win?"
    a3: "Our ambassador Patrick Switzer will announce when an item is no longer for sale and determine the winner with a random dynamic. It all depends on Patrick’s crazy imagination."
    q4: "If you can afford these awesome items, how come you’re asking for money?"
    a4: "All the items we are having for sale where generously donated by our sponsors. This is a non-profit cause with the only objective to take the kids of Team Venados to compete at Maryhill."
    q5: "Any other question?"
    a5: "Email us!"
  irving:
    des: "17 Years old | 1.5 Years practicing longboard"
    info: "“Tito” is the youngest one of the crew. But that has not stopped him to continue practicing and competing with the big guys. The first time that Tito saw the city riders going down the hills he fell an amazing curiosity to ride a longboard. The first time they borrow him a table, he immediately felt in love with the sport."
  hector:
    des: "17 Years old | 1.5 Years practicing longboard"
    info: "“Toro” is the older one of the team. At the beginning he wasn’t attracted by the sport at all, it was not until after his friends began to ride more regularly and tell him all their experiences and feelings you can experience with the sport.  Toro also practices baseball and bull riding." 
  gerardo:
    des: "17 Years old | 3 Years practicing longboard"
    info: "Gera is the most rebel of all the crew but also the one who loves and works more the field where he grew. If he its not riding a longboard, you can see him riding a horse in the town going to take care of his animals (cows and horses) or preparing to ride a bull in the rodeo nights of the town."
  ulises:
    des: "15 Years old | 3.5 Years practicing longboard"
    info: "Uriel is the one with more experience practicing the sport and the one with better positions in the competitions. He practices everyday because he knows that this is the only way to get in the first places, besides he is aware of its potential thanks to its good results in last competitions. One of his main goals is to go and compete in Maryhill, not just once but several."
